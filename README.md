# Smart-Energy-Meter-uisng-Blynk-IOT
This project monitors real-time electrical parameters—voltage, current, power, and frequency—using the PZEM-004T sensor and sends live data to the Blynk IoT platform via ESP8266. It enables remote energy monitoring through a mobile app, helping users track power usage efficiently.
